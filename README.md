Spring Boot CRUD Application
This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application developed using Spring Boot as part of a Java programming lecture. The purpose of this project was to practice building RESTful web services and to understand how CRUD operations work in real-world applications.

Background
As part of our lecture series on Spring Framework and Spring Boot, we explored the basics of creating web applications, REST APIs, and database connectivity using Java. After covering the fundamental concepts of Spring Boot, we collectively decided that building a CRUD application would be an excellent hands-on project to reinforce what we had learned.

This CRUD application allows us to practice the following concepts:

Creating RESTful APIs using Spring Boot
Connecting to a database using Spring Data JPA
Performing basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on an entity
Handling HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with appropriate status codes
